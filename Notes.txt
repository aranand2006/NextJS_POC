React JS - Library
           Not have the all the features , so need to install based on the Requirement
           Forexample - Router is not in build function in React js. so need to install	
           only support the Client side library

        		   

Next JS  - Frame work
           --all the features are already in build in Framework - all th
		   Support the Server side Render and client side Render
		   Next js developed used the React Core
		   React js Framework
		   we can use all the React features same to React js
		   Components,Redux,context all the features also supported in Next JS
		   Some of features also not done in React js . so this features also we will implement in Next JS. That is maxt in d/w b/w react js and nextjs
		   It is have also backend Support. 
           we write the both frontend and Backend code in same place.
		   Main advantage is we will deside which component CSR need and Which component need SSR. 
		   Network Boundary us 
		    Notes : Next js same to PHP. Because PHP worked on the  UI and Backend also. this same idea was used to next js	   
		  
		  
CSR vs SSR:

    CSR :  UI code loaded in Browser  - React JS is one of the client side Render
	       Loading time very fast if using CSR
		   example : Youtube using client side rendering
		   Security low

    SSR	:  all the UI rendered to Server and send to UI side
	       taking some more time for loading
		   all the content rendered same time
		   security high.
		   Create payment gateway page in SSR - because more secure
