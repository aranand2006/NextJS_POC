React JS - Library
           Not have the all the features , so need to install based on the Requirement
           Forexample - Router is not in build function in React js. so need to install	
           only support the Client side library

        		   

Next JS  - Frame work
           --all the features are already in build in Framework - all th
		   Support the Server side Render and client side Render
		   Next js developed used the React Core
		   React js Framework
		   we can use all the React features same to React js
		   Components,Redux,context all the features also supported in Next JS
		   Some of features also not done in React js . so this features also we will implement in Next JS. That is maxt in d/w b/w react js and nextjs
		   It is have also backend Support. 
           we write the both frontend and Backend code in same place.
		   Main advantage is we will deside which component CSR need and Which component need SSR. 
		   Network Boundary us 
		    Notes : Next js same to PHP. Because PHP worked on the  UI and Backend also. this same idea was used to next js
			
			
		   	
		   
		  
		  
CSR vs SSR:

    CSR :  UI code loaded in Browser  - React JS is one of the client side Render
	       Loading time very fast if using CSR
		   example : Youtube using client side rendering
		   Security low

    SSR	:  all the UI rendered to Server and send to UI side
	       taking some more time for loading
		   all the content rendered same time
		   security high.
		   Create payment gateway page in SSR - because more secure
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Create create Next js app:
	>npx create-next-app@latest
	
	next asked some questions:
	 1.Projecct Name?
	 2.use Typescript ?
	 3.use EsLint ?
	 4.TailwindCss
	 5.src/directory?
	 6.app router?
	 7.import alias?
	 
	 
	Start next app:
	  npm run dev
	  
Next js support the nodejs 18.17 after

  so use below comment
    >nvm use 18.17.0
	
	>nvm install 20.0.1
	
	>nvm ls-remote  -- check the version list -nvm
	
	
	>nvm install v20.17.0
	
	--next js used file based Routing
	

Two ways of file structure 
    1.create file structure using src folder
	2.without src folder
	
jsconfig.js	
   some configurations avaliable for import file 
    with src      :  paths : {"@/* : ["./*"]  }
	without src   :  paths : {"@/* : ["./src/*"]  }

 Layout.js
     outer contaier file pages
	 for example need to add nav to all the files then add the nav is layout.js enough
	 
	 --Note : 
	   suppose you have five pages , you want to add separate nav design for 2 pages. that is possible using layout files
	   
	   
--------------------------------------------------------


Font Useage:

  in layout.js changes
  create fotn.js
  
   import { Montserrat, Oswald } from "next/font/google";
export const montserrat Montserrat({
subsets: ["latin"],
display: "swap",
weight: ["300", "400", "600", "800"],
});
export const oswald = Oswald({
subsets: ["latin"],
display: "swap",
weight: ["200", "300", "400", "700"],
});  
	 
-----------

Home.js
import { oswald } from "./fonts";
export default function Home() {
return (
<div className={styles.page}>
<h1 className=Coswald.className)>Hello world</h1>
<main className={styles.main}>	 


meta and tile changes
 
  og - meta tag
  
  twitter  - twitter tag
  
  page.js


  export const metadata = () => {
return {
title: "Home Page Dynamic",
description: "Home page for my next seriess",
openGraph: {
title: "For Social Media dynamic",
description: "My self Desc",
images: ["https://sdf.com/sdf.jpeg"],
},
};
};

  
  export const generateMetadata = () => {
return {
title: "Home Page Dynamic",
description: "Home page for my next seriess",
openGraph: {
title: "For Social Media dynamic",
description: "My self Desc",
images: ["https://sdf.com/sdf.jpeg"],
},
};
};

SSR / Server side compoents  vs CSR /client side components


SSR : rendered and Server and send to Browser (delviered to Browser)

CSR :  React cmponents 


In Default in next js - Server side rendered

Server side Render adv :

  1. Streming  
      For example rendered from server - not need to render all the data in browser in same time. strem to small chunks files streaming in render
	  next data come then again rendering using streming
  2. Post paint timing 
       Large content paining (LCP)
	   facing some complicated when we have more datas or content  for rendering 
	   so all the content rendered in server and send to browser	   
	   
  3. SEO:
  
      East to implement SEO in server side. because all the contents initialy loaded in server side and send to Browser. so all the pages are active
        

CSR Adv :

  1. React hooks ,dom manipulation,Event Listener are not supported in SSR
   if you implement the above in Next js - we will get the error. because Next js default is SSR. 
   if you implemtnt the CSR in next js then 
       'use client ' add to component file in first line
    Client side storage - local storage,session storage are     using only CSR
   
	
 RSC payload (React server component payload):
 
      how is working rendering SSR :
                     using RSPC
					 
	  Data + client JS instruction = server -> html (that is used for get the next js server component data and JS instruction 
	                                                 rendered HTML format in server 
													  next send to browser and maintain page is intractive)
													  
   Notes : 
   
       In Next js we want to Analysis the which code is CSR and SSR
	   for example : first deside the CSR need in server
	   syntax for CSR in next js "use client" write in top of page.
